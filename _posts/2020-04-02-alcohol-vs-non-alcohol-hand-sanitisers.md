Washing with warm water and soap remains the gold standard for hand hygiene and preventing the spread of infectious
diseases. Hand sanitisers can also protect against disease-causing microbes, especially in situations when soap and water are
not available.

But what are the differences between an alcohol based hand sanitiser and an alcohol free hand sanitiser?

##### Alcohol Hand Sanitisers
Alcohol based hand sanitisers will contain one of two active ingredients; alcohol or isopropanol. One distinct property that
they both share is that they are highly flammable. Hand sanitisers contain 60%-95% alcohol for maximum efficacy, however
this high concentration has long raised concerns in both the media and the health care community. The major concern
with alcohol-based hand sanitisers is the potential toxicity hazards upon ingestion. Most dispensing machines for hand
sanitisers are easy to open, therefore caution must be exercised whenever children and chemicals share the same
environment. With the high levels of alcohol concentration, consumption can lead to alcohol poisoning in children and
adults

A common side-effect often associated with the repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers is the dryness and cracking
that it can cause on hands. This occurs because the alcohol strips away oils in your skin that retain moisture. The temporary
absence of these oils can lead to increased skin irritation on the hands. It can even lead to symptoms of dermatitis.

##### Non-Alcohol Hand Sanitisers
For over 10 years, **No Germs** has been a strong advocate for alcohol free based hand sanitisers, long before COVID-19.
Alcohol free products contain the active ingredient _benzalkonium chloride_, a quaternary ammonium. Unlike alcohol based
hand sanitisers, it is non-flammable, and low concentrations of benzalkonium make it non-toxic. One of the biggest benefits
of a benzalkonium chloride hand sanitiser is that an alcohol-based productâ€™s ability to kill bacteria ends once the product has
dried on the skin, but benzalkonium-based products continue to provide protection well after the solution has dried. They
also pose much less of a threat in cases of accidental ingestion.

##### What is Benzalkonium Chloride?
Benzalkonium Chloride has been used globally as an antibacterial for over 50 years, and is primarily used as a preservative and antimicrobial agent, and secondarily used as a surfactant. It works by killing microorganisms and inhibiting their future growth, and for this reason frequently appears as an ingredient in antibacterial hand wipes, hand sanitisers and antiseptic creams. Amid the COVID-19 health pandemic, the TGA recommends disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride) to be suitable for use, and has identified this active ingredient as being critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

A study from 2019 compared a benzalkonium chloride hand sanitiser against a standard ethanol based hand sanitiser. The sanitiser was applied and the bacterial activity on the fingertips of the subject was measured at 1, 2 and 4 hours after application. The subjects with the benzalkonium chloride based hand sanitiser reliably and consistently returned low counts of bacteria than the subjects with the ethanol based hand sanitiser and these results were highly significant.
