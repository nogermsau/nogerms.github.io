_Hand hygiene is the single most effective way to reduce and prevent health associated infections._

It is not surprising that given our current health crisis, and coupled with the spotlight on hand washing via the World Health Organisation, that hand hygiene has become a topic of interest and relevance.

Health acquired infections have been on the rise over the past few years and especially now with the COVID-19 global outbreak. There is a great necessity for the implementation of hand hygiene programs which include hand sanitising products, particularly for staff members in the workplace.

**No Germs** understands that in your organisation, interpersonal collaboration among staff members, and face to face interaction with clients is part of your day to day operations. Our product offering will provide protection to your valued staff and your highly regarded clients, and aims to reduce and prevent infection within the workplace.

We have devised a **3 step hand hygiene program** to help reduce absenteeism in the workplace and protect your valued staff and customers.
