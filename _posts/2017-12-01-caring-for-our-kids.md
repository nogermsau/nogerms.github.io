Official figures released by NSW Health state that more than 1,600 people have been presented to NSW emergency departments with gastroenteritis in the last week, a 14% increase on last year. No Germs Founder, Peter Ross is a father and grandfather, and knows what an impact that can have on families and how important it is to have safe environments for people (especially children) to live, learn and play in.

Peter has been working with Early Learning Centre owners and managers for over a decade to safely and effectively treat and prevent bacterial outbreaks, particularly Norovirus, using safe, effective products and techniques.

Peter says "We at No Germs have a proven strategy that has minimised any outbreak interruption to the daily running of early learning centres. Our services in the removal of bacteria to kill hand, foot and mouth disease and norovirus are proven. We can quickly take action against bacterial infections using a water based product called Zoono* that is non toxic, non allergic and food safe. We use the broadest and safest biocide agent available to ensure happy, healthy kids, carers and parents."

Jeffrey Yarham, Director of Happy Faces Daycare in Panania had an outbreak of Norovirus. He said 'We had an outbreak of Norovirus (gastro) among the children and carers totalling around 12 cases, and we closed the centre. I immediately contacted No Germs who responded straight away and came to treat the premises. We reopened the centre the following day and had no additional cases reported (even several weeks later).
