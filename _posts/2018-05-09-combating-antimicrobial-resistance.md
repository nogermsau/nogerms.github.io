In the Official NSW Food Authority magazine Food Wise published in November, 2016, it draws attention to the growing incidence of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). Figures released indicate that AMR is growing in notoriety in a similar fashion in the health and medical industry of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Some antibiotics are now not strong enough to inhibit a range of bugs that we have now entered the era of Superbugs.

Watch how we at No Germs apply our products and techniques in an actual food processing facility.

This is now causing great concern in the food industry that AMR will endanger food safety.

Last year a National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2015-2019 was developed by the Commonwealth Department Health, the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and industry stakeholders to minimize the spread of antimicrobial resistance, and to ensure that over time there is continued access to effective antimicrobials. Most products used in the food industry today are food grade chemicals. In simple terms they have been able to kill whatever organisms including bacteria by basically poisoning them. That was generally understood to be the case until recently where there have been a growing number of reported cases of the bacteria including Listeria, Salmonella and E.coli, developing an increasing resistance in individual cases.

Is there a response to this growing problem? At No Germs we say there is an efficient, cost effective alternative. For years now we have been using either one of two products in our armory with amazing results. Both of these products are food safe, non-oxidative and environmentally friendly.

Both of these products act by what is termed Lysis or a ‘physical kill’ of all bacteria instead of the chemical kill to which bacteria and microbe resistance is now developing. Lysis is biologically described as the disintegration of a cell by rupturing the cell or wall membrane. This means because there is no resistance to cell rupture there can be no possibility of pathogen resistance. This also means that there can be no opportunity for the development of superbugs.
