              <h3>For the health, safety and well-being of children and carers</h3>
              <p>We are parents and grandparents, so we know what it means to have an unhealthy child. We are also business owners and recognise that infections within an early learning centre also means sick carers, costly replacement staff, additional reporting and operational disruption. The health, safety and well-being of children and carers alike is critical to ensure happy homes and workplaces for everyone.</p>

              <h3>Proven Strategy</h3>
              <p>No Germs has a proven strategy that has minimised any outbreak interruption to the daily running of daycare and early learning centres. Our services in the removal of bacteria to kill hand, foot and mouth disease and norovirus are proven. We can quickly take action against bacterial infections using a water based product called Zoono that is non toxic, non allergic and food safe. We use the broadest and safest biocide agent available to ensure happy, healthy kids, carers and parents.</p>

      <h3>The Zoono Difference</h3>
      <p>Zoono is the most effective product we use widely in daycare and early learning centres. It is water based, safe, non-toxic, long-lasting (an application can last 30-40 days) and will create a germ free environment and stop cross-contamination in your centre. Zoono works by bonding to surfaces (both hard and soft fabric surfaces) to form a protective shield that continuously kills germs for extended periods of time. It can continue to protect the surface, even after regular cleaning. On hands, Zoonoâ€™s 24-Hour Hand Protectant provides 24-hour protection with one application and stays on skin even after regular hand washing.
