              <h3>For the health, safety and well-being of children and carers</h3>
              <p>We are parents and grandparents, so we know what it means to have an unhealthy child. We are also business owners and recognise that infections within an early learning centre also means sick carers, costly replacement staff, additional reporting and operational disruption. The health, safety and well-being of children and carers alike is critical to ensure happy homes and workplaces for everyone.</p>

      <h3>The No Germs Difference</h3>
      <p>No Germs uses advanced antimicrobial technology in daycare and early learning centres via our <a href="/commercial/fogging_and-misting">fogging spray service</a>.  The formulation is water based, safe, non-toxic, long-lasting (an application can last 30-40 days) and will create a germ free environment and stop cross-contamination in your centre.  It works by bonding to surfaces (both hard and soft fabric surfaces) to form a protective shield that continuously kills germs for extended periods of time. It can continue to protect the surface, even after regular cleaning.  On hands, our powerful yet gentle <a href="/commercial/hand-sanitiser">hand sanitisers</a> provides up to 24-hour protection with one application, and stays on skin even after regular hand washing.  Our alcohol free formulation means it is completely safe for children as it is non toxic and free from dangerous chemicals.
