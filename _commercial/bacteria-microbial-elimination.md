              <h3>Proven best-in-class products delivering value to your business</h3>
              <p>We have over 30 years' experience in the management and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards. No Germs has continued to explore and utilise the best-in-class and most effective products available. We continue to refine our methods as they are constantly tested in a wide variety of Sydney's challenging business environments.
              <br><br>
              The products that No Germs use work by physically killing the pathogen. This means mechanical disruption rather than chemical poisoning and means the product is safe and the outcomes are better and provide longer lasting results. Pathogens cannot build up a tolerance to the products which mean that repeat uses continue to be just as effective.
              <br><br>
              A No Germs program can provide significant benefits to your business. This includes:
              <ul id="bacteria">
                <li>Protection of your staff and customers against illness</li>
                <li>Improvement in operational capability, reduction in business interruptions</li>
                <li>Reduced risk to your reputation and brand</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>More about Zoono</h3>
            <p>Zoono is colourless, odourless, non-leaching, environmentally safe, non-corrosive and whilst completely gentle for humans and animals, it is deadly for a wide range of bacteria and mould. Zoono does not contain harmful chemicals, as a liquid Zoono is less toxic than vitamin C and coffee.
            <br><br>
            When applied to a surface by spraying, wiping or ‘fogging’; Zoono leaves behind a mono-molecular layer that permanently bonds to the surface. These molecules are antimicrobial, silane based polymers that covalently bond to the surface forming a barrier of positively charged microscopic pins. The layer of molecular antimicrobial pins carries on working for up to 30 days on surfaces. Routine cleaning can continue and does not disrupt the Zoono molecule or its antimicrobial activity.</p>

            <h3>Chlorine Dioxide</h3>
            <p>As a broad spectrum antimicrobial, Chlorine Dioxide is effective against viruses, mould, fungi and algae over wide temperature and ph ranges. Chlorine Dioxide delivers 'physical' kills against a these microorganisms over a short period of contact time and when properly applied, it minimises toxic residues. It also minimises corrosion to equipment such as tanks, lines as it true dissolved gas in water when compared to chlorine.
            <br><br>
            Common applications include:
            <ul>
              <li>Microbial control of flumes, processing waters, retort waters, cooling canals, warmers, and coolers</li>
              <li>Fruit and vegetable rinses. Uncut and unpeeled, as well as cut and peeled (potable rinse required)</li>
              <li>Food contact surface sanitiser for all processing equipment surfaces</li>
              <li>Rendering facilities for odour control</li>
              <li>Whole plant potable water treatment</li>
            </ul>
