      <h5>MOST DISINFECTANTS DO ONLY HALF THE JOB</h5>
      <p>They kill what’s on the surface at the time but, after they’ve evaporated, they offer no  protection against what’s to come. No matter  how frequent your sanitising cycle is, it’s  impossible to keep up with recontamination,  leaving employees, customers and visitors vulnerable for extended periods of time.</p>
      <h5>SO, DON’T JUST SANITISE - NANOTISE™</h5>
      <p>Our innovative Nanotise™ antimicrobial fogging treatment uses nanotechnology to offer next level protection against 99.9% of germs, viruses (including COVID-19) and bacteria for up to 30 days after application.  With applications done after hours, there’s no disruption to your day-to-day operations.</p>
