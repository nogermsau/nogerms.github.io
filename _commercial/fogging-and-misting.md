              <h3>How our service works</h3>
              <p>Our qualified technician will attend your premises and use an ATP luminometer to check the bacterial levels within the working area. The premises will then be fogged/misted with our lab tested surface spray product via our fogging machine, which is set at a very fine 20 microns. Our product is food safe, does not contain alcohol or poisons and is non toxic. The following areas are targeted as part of our cleaning service (generally any 'touch point' areas), however please discuss with your technician if you have any specific areas you would like to treat.</p>

              <p>Treatment performs best on recently cleaned surfaces and will provide ongoing protection against bacteria, viruses, mould and mildew for 30 days. Following treatment, surfaces can be wiped down with warm soapy water to remove any debris without affecting the efficacy of the hygiene treatment. Following the fogging, the technician will answer any questions and provide advice on how to maintain a germ free environment.</p>
